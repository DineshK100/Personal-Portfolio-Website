### Hosting

I did a lot of researching into the ways I should host this website online and the quickest and most reliable way was to use Amazon Web Services. I followed the basic structure of buying a domain on namecheap.com and using Route 53 to connect that domain to the website (through the name servers given by AWS) I then used Amazon's S3 to create a bucket to which I uploaded all the necessary project documents and enabled the static hosting feature.
